# Website Chosen and Rationale
For this project, I chose a well-structured e-commerce website specializing in building materials. The clean HTML layout made it easy to scrape, and its niche focus provided a unique dataset, distinct from more common targets like fashion or electronics. This combination made it ideal for both educational and practical scraping purposes.

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions
A key challenge was handling the site's nested category structure. To address this, I created a custom data model to represent these categories in a scalable manner. Although I didn’t fully implement it in the final output due to time constraints, I am proud of the structure, as it adds flexibility for future enhancements.

The scraping process, including extracting product name, brand, price, category, and description, was mostly straightforward. However, juggling multiple assignments limited the time I had for some parts, which led to rushing certain aspects. Despite this, the scraper reliably performs its core task.

## Analysis of Collected Data
The scraper collected the following fields:

- Product name
- Brand
- Price
- Category
- Description
- (Optional) Image link

The data is structured and clean, making it suitable for market analysis or simple product indexing. While deeper insights such as brand frequency or pricing trends weren’t explored due to time limits, the collected data is ready for future analysis with tools like pandas or matplotlib.

## Potential Improvements or Extensions
One improvement I’d like to explore is adding a user interface that allows users to visually select elements or configure what data to scrape. Although not required for this project, I’m interested in implementing this feature in the future.

Additionally, the collected price data offers opportunities for deeper analysis. I could apply statistical methods like category-wise price distribution, average and mean prices, standard deviation, and even test price authenticity using Benford’s Law. These insights could be visualized with libraries like matplotlib for clearer interpretation.
